				<p>
					<span>In dark and early ages, through the primal forests faring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere the soul came shining into prehistoric night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twofold man was equal; they were comrades dear and daring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Living wild and free together in unreasoning delight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ere the soul was born and consciousness came slowly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere the soul was born, to man and woman, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere he found the Tree of Knowledge, that awful tree and holy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere he knew he felt, and knew he knew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then said he to Pain, “I am wise now, and I know you!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more will I suffer while power and wisdom last!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he to Pleasure, “I am strong, and I will show you</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the will of man can seize you⁠—aye, and hold you fast!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Food he ate for pleasure, and wine he drank for gladness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And woman? Ah, the woman! the crown of all delight!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His now⁠—he knew it! He was strong to madness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that early dawning after prehistoric night.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His⁠—his forever! That glory sweet and tender!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, but he would love her! And she should love but him!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would work and struggle for her, he would shelter and defend her⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She should never leave him, never, till their eyes in death were dim.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Close, close he bound her, that she should leave him never;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weak still he kept her, lest she be strong to flee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the fainting flame of passion he kept alive forever</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all the arts and forces of earth and sky and sea.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, ah, the long journey! The slow and awful ages</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They have labored up together, blind and crippled, all astray!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through what a mighty volume, with a million shameful pages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the freedom of the forests to the prisons of to-day!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Food he ate for pleasure, and it slew him with diseases!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wine he drank for gladness, and it led the way to crime!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And woman? He will hold her⁠—he will have her when he pleases⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he never once hath seen her since the prehistoric time!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Gone the friend and comrade of the day when life was younger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She who rests and comforts, she who helps and saves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still he seeks her vainly, with a never-dying hunger;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone beneath his tyrants, alone above his slaves!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Toiler, bent and weary with the load of thine own making!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou who art sad and lonely, though lonely all in vain!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who hast sought to conquer Pleasure and have her for the taking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found that Pleasure only was another name for Pain⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nature hath reclaimed thee, forgiving dispossession!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God hath not forgotten, though man doth still forget!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The woman-soul is rising, in despite of thy transgression⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loose her now, and trust her! She will love thee yet!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Love thee? She will love thee as only freedom knoweth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love thee? She will love thee while Love itself doth live!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fear not the heart of woman! No bitterness it showeth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ages of her sorrow have but taught her to forgive!</span>
